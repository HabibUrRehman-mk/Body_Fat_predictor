# Body_Fat_predictor

This model is built using the scikit-learn library in Python, and the dataset is sourced from Kaggle.

The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 70%, as the Density parameter was intentionally dropped to make the predictor usable for everyone.
Even without this parameter, the model provides a reliable approximation of body fat percentage.
